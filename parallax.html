    <h1>Make (and wear) Masks</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The best fabric for homemade masks is a tightly woven, 100% cotton fabric. Things like bed sheets, curtains, and woven shirts are good options if they're made entirely out of cotton. If you're going to donate the masks, we recommend avoiding knit fabrics (e.g. jersey T-shirts) because they create holes when they stretch, which the virus could get through. Make sure to prewash fabrics using hot water to kill germs and to pre-shrink the material so it doesn't change shape after healthcare workers wash it themselves.</p>
